# Rain World SCDS
Rain World Slugcat Dating Sim

by forthbridge (forthbridge#0683) and KADW (KADW#4425)

Version 1.1

A mod for Rain World 1.9 (Downpour DLC) that makes it easier to access the official dating sim that comes with More Slugcats. (Yes, it's real.)

Default controls: Press D to open it up. From the sim, press the pause button to return to the main menu. These controls can be configured in the settings.

Mod concept and thumbnail art by badgerotter. Forthbridge made the version 1.1 update, so thanks to them for the input config and the fact that it no longer breaks the newest version of Rain World (currently v1.9.07)!

Available through Steam Workshop/Remix at [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2923504146), so get it from there. Commented source files are in this repo.

If you don't have Rain World through Steam, you can still install this mod by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP. Move RainWorldSCDS_final into your Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder.
